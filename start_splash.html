<!-- storyboard info 

fade in  "kore9" fade out (when you fade in you could have vertical bar/panels
moving around)

fade in/ or continue with "in conjunction with Bump IT [use blue outline logo] (tilt shake, or bounce slightly)"

present

Nodz (long o) fly in the parts using Raphael. see drawing you have somewhere

present "skip intro >>" flower right (only at this point do we set cookie so it skips next time). might be a fun thing to have different cartoons if they've already seen demo, or everytime you get to site (like google only more practical and oriented towards iot). and always the same style of cartoon. maybe not practical later on.

once flowin in fade the edges to glow white hot, left to right to left and then the whole thing, whole page, and then to black

fade the whole thing to black for a while, good to have space


present choices
[sign in],  [watch demo],  register with your phone and email (and create a bunch of nodes in the process). take an extra 15 seconds and connect two of them.

wait

"y"ou know what you could do?""

combine demo with registration

they configure node as they register

email

text


wow, you just created your first two nodes! great job!

go ahead, you know you want to, connect together

[draw line or smash them together]

great job!

"wow", you say, "that's different"

"and easy"

"yes"

"it is different"


"oh, and it's free"

"too good to be true, you say"

"well, almost, but we do ask you to read our newsletter every couple of weeks (and maybe check a box that you read it), and we may add some banner ads at some point or something like that, probably with iot software or  productivity apps that you should already be using.""

"and that's it"

"one last thing"

and don't be fooled. nodz is simple and easy but also powerful by way of limitless easy-to-configure combinations. we can't wait to see where it goes and know you won't be able to either."

enjoy, and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

[link to repeat the above with a bouncing ball on top of it]


OR

something more direct

Nodz is the easiest way to connect devices and apps on the web.

Sign up now and in 2 minutes you'll have two nodz with which to connect devices

Then just walk them through creating config nodes and connecting

Explain that its free with a newsletter and some ads.

roadmap would be to add developers, so would want a link here

start of splash page should also have login, and skip there, but if cartoons are good, they may stay, probably plenty of material with nodes and the internet "your flickr got on my snapchat. Yeah I know". flickr and snapchat, two great tastes that...no, we won't say it

so could be textual or graphical (cartoon). pulling in a smartcar node from an email node "where do you think your going?"

or company info, or not, or rarely
